            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, I will be choosing a public user interface to observe. I will create two personas
              and a storyboard to better understand the interface. 
            </p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              I chose to observe people's interactions with the printer in Barus and Holley. 
            </p>

            <div class="gallery-container">
              <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/interface.png" alt="dry white bread" width="800">
            </div>

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p>
              After observing three users, I noticed the following: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When Person A swiped their ID, and nothing was released from the printer. They opened and 
                used their laptop for 3 minutes before swiping their ID a second time and receiving a print. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Person A spent around 4 minutes fiddling with the printer before they realized they had to swipe their ID to release a print job. Persons B and C immediately swiped their ID cards upon approaching the printer. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Person B picked up their printed document, and looked confused and dissatisfied.
              </li>
              <li>All 3 users that used the printer only had one document to print. However, Persons A and B used the “print” button next to the button, while Person C used the “print all” button at the bottom of the screen. </li>
              <li>
                None of the users touched the keyboard
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I then interviewed each of the three users and obtained the following summarized responses: 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>What are you trying to print? Is this a necessary item? </li>
              Two people were printing necessary items- a mandatory reading and resume for the career fair, while one person was printing a decorative piece for their room. 
              <li>How frequently do you use this printer?</li>
              Person C uses the printer around once a week, while persons A and B have experience with printing at Brown, but have never used the printer I was observing. 
              <li>What would you have done if the printer did not work?</li>
              Both people who were printing mandatory documents noted they would find a printer in a different building, while Person C noted they would have returned home empty handed. 
              Persons A and B noted they were in a rush to use/hand in their printed documents. Finding a printer in a different building would have caused a time delay for both users. 
              <li>How effective was the printer in fulfilling your goals? </li>
              Person B’s goal was not fulfilled because they wanted their document printed in color.
            </ol>


            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>
              To create detail about the individuals, I created two personas using empathy maps. 
              The empathy maps help provide a visual for what the users think, feel, say, and do. 
            </p>
            <div class="gallery-container">
              <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/pamela.png" alt="pamela" height="600">
            </div>
            <p>
              The first persona I constructed is Procrastinating Pamela. Pamela is a busy college student taking five courses and involved in multiple extracurricular clubs. She has a tendency to leave assignments for the last minute. 
              Pamela uses the printer frequently to print her readings and homework assignments. Her main problem with the current interface is that it does not support adjusting the number of copies needed. Additionally, Pamela finds the interface for the printer to be slow, and the printing process is longer than she needs. 
              Pamela represents the busy students using the printers across Brown. Many students frequently use the printer, but find it inconvenient to submit multiple documents or print multiple copies. These students are looking for convenient and efficient ways to print necessary documents. 

            </p>

           

            <div class="gallery-container">
              <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/abe.png" alt="abe" height="600">
            </div>
            <p>
              The second persona I constructed is Artsy Abe. Abe is a first year Brown-RISD Dual Degree student who just moved to campus, and is looking to fill his room with decor. 
              Abe has never used the printers at Brown before. His main problem with the interface is that there are no directions for submitting documents to the printer. The home screen on the monitor does not immediately suggest the printer is associated with the monitor, which causes Abe to struggle with using the printer.
              Abe represents the new students on campus who are unfamiliar with the printer. These users are not necessarily printing with urgency, but rather using the printer as a device to express creativity. People like Abe are looking for quality prints, rather than speed of printing.

            </div>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
